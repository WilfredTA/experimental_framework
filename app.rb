# This simple app shows examples of how to use the 
# following features of the framework:
# 1. Setting routes
# 2. Rendering templates
# 3. Setting redirects
# 4. Rendering a template within a layout
# 5. Grabbing the route being requested
# 6. Comparing the requested route against the set routes
#   and executing the matching route

# Any app built with this framework should have a call method, 
# within which the following is done in the order listed below:
# First, routes are added
# Second, logic is added to routes, as are view templates
# Third, grab the requested route with 'get_requested_route(env)'
# Fourth, pass the requested route into the 'route' method

# The framework makes the following assumptions:
# That you are using ERB as your templating engine
# That your templates are stored in a directory called 'views'
# That you are using routes to generate responses


# The following UserRouter is added to test functions as I integrate user capability into the
# application
